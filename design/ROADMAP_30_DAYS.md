**Deliverable:** Message "explain binary trees" → classified as DSA → routed correctly

---

### Day 17–18: DSA Agent + Tools

**Goal:** First fully functional agent: explains DSA, generates problems, reviews code.

- [ ] System prompt: `DSA_MENTOR_PROMPT` (Socratic, step-by-step, hints before answers)
- [ ] `NoteSearchTool.java` — `@Tool` → calls `QdrantService.similaritySearch()`
- [ ] `QuestionGeneratorTool.java` — `@Tool` → LLM generates problem by topic + difficulty

- [ ] `docker-compose up` still works clean

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| LangChain4J API changes | Pin exact version in pom.xml; check changelog before upgrading |
| Qdrant embedding dimension mismatch | Set dimension once at collection creation; never change model mid-project |
| Gemini rate limits during testing | Use `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` for dev/test; `gemini-2.0-flash` only for eval |
| Judge0 latency for code execution | Show "Running..." spinner; 10s timeout with user-friendly error |
| Context window overflow on large PDFs | Chunk + truncate at `ContextAssembler`; max 5 chunks per query |
| JWT secret in code | Use environment variable `JWT_SECRET`; never commit to git |

---
